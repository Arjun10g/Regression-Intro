            <h2>Conducting an Interview</h2>

            <p>This chapter provided a comprehensive guide on how interviews were conducted, with a particular focus on semi-structured life-world interviews. The chapter covered various stages of the interview process, emphasizing the importance of preparation, different types of questions, and active listening. The aim was to enable interviewers to fully concentrate on the subject while being mindful of the social structures that influenced the interview process.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Interviews were recognized as a key method for gathering qualitative data, especially in the social sciences. This chapter emphasized the importance of mastering interviewing techniques rather than adhering to strict rules. Reflexivity, the ability to reflect on one’s position and biases, was noted as critical in successfully conducting interviews. According to Bourdieu, reflexivity during interviews allowed for better management of the conversation, with awareness of the social structure playing an essential role.</p>

            <h3>Semi-Structured Life World Interview</h3>
            <p>Semi-structured interviews offered a flexible framework, utilizing a guide to address specific themes, yet allowing the conversation to flow naturally based on the participant’s responses. This approach was deemed particularly useful for exploring participants’ lived experiences. The interviewer's role was to follow up on narratives and delve deeper into the stories that the interviewee shared.</p>

            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><p><strong>Example:</strong> In a study on healthcare workers, the interviewer might have begun with broad questions about their daily responsibilities, but then adjusted the focus to elaborate on specific challenges they experienced, such as managing stress during emergencies.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Class Interview Example</h3>
            <p>During a workshop at Saybrook Institute, an example of a semi-structured interview about grades was demonstrated. This example highlighted how interviews could reveal both explicit memories and underlying emotions through probing and follow-up questions. The interviewee reflected on receiving a high grade and the mixed emotions associated with it—both pride and a sense of isolation from peers who performed less well.</p>

            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><p><strong>Example:</strong> The interviewer initiated with the question, "Do you remember the first time you received a grade?" The interviewee recalled the vivid memory of receiving a red star in primary school. Probing questions helped reveal mixed feelings about the praise, exposing a conflict between the positive relationship with the teacher and the peer group's envy.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Setting the Interview Stage</h3>
            <p>It was emphasized that creating a comfortable and respectful environment was key to encouraging openness from the participant. The interviewer was expected to explain the purpose of the interview, outline the use of recording devices, and address any concerns. A debriefing session at the end was suggested to help ease any tension and potentially uncover additional insights from the interviewee.</p>

            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><p><strong>Example:</strong> In interviews on sensitive subjects, such as trauma, it was advised that the interviewer begin by explaining the purpose of the study, emphasizing confidentiality, and fostering a sense of safety to encourage open dialogue.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Scripting the Interview</h3>
            <p>An interview guide, or script, was deemed essential to ensure that all relevant topics were covered while allowing flexibility during the conversation. The guide could include a sequence of questions, but it was crucial for interviewers to adapt to participants’ responses. A balance between gathering thematic knowledge and facilitating a dynamic conversation was highlighted.</p>

            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><p><strong>Example:</strong> In research focusing on work-life balance, interviewers might have prepared specific questions about daily routines but remained open to following the participant’s lead if unexpected topics, like mental health, arose.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Types of Interview Questions</h3>
            <p>The chapter outlined several types of questions that served different purposes during the interview. A mix of these questions allowed the interviewer to fully explore the subject while keeping the conversation fluid.</p>

            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><p><strong>Introductory Questions:</strong> These opened the interview, aiming to gather initial responses. <strong>Example:</strong> "Can you tell me about a typical day at your job?"</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Follow-up Questions:</strong> These aimed to delve deeper into initial responses. <strong>Example:</strong> "You mentioned stress—can you explain more about what causes that stress?"</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Probing Questions:</strong> These were designed to uncover more detail or explanation. <strong>Example:</strong> "Could you provide a specific example of a challenging situation?"</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Specifying Questions:</strong> These aimed to gather precise details about actions or feelings. <strong>Example:</strong> "When you mentioned stress, what actions did you take to manage it?"</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Direct Questions:</strong> These addressed the main topics head-on. <strong>Example:</strong> "How do you believe your relationship with your supervisor impacts your performance?"</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Indirect Questions:</strong> These were used to reveal the participant’s thoughts indirectly. <strong>Example:</strong> "How do you think your colleagues perceive your work habits?"</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Structuring Questions:</strong> These helped transition from one topic to another. <strong>Example:</strong> "Let’s move on to discuss your experience with remote work."</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Silence:</strong> Pauses allowed the interviewee to reflect and elaborate further. <strong>Example:</strong> After an emotional response, a moment of silence might prompt the interviewee to continue their thoughts.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Interpreting Questions:</strong> These confirmed the interviewer’s understanding of the participant's responses. <strong>Example:</strong> "It seems like you feel the workload is unmanageable. Is that correct?"</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Art of Second Questions</h3>
            <p>The chapter emphasized that mastering second questions was vital for effective interviews. Active listening allowed interviewers to ask follow-up questions that explored deeper meanings within the participant’s responses. This process revealed additional insights that might not have been evident in the initial answers.</p>

            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><p><strong>Example:</strong> If a participant said, "I was extremely stressed last month," a second question such as, "What contributed to that stress?" would help the interviewer uncover more specific information about the causes.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Closing the Interview</h3>
            <p>At the end of the interview, it was recommended to summarize the key points discussed and give the participant the opportunity to add any final thoughts. This reflective moment often led to new insights. Additionally, informal conversations after the recording was turned off could reveal further valuable information. Careful consideration was needed regarding the use of this material to ensure ethical standards were maintained.</p>

            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><p><strong>Example:</strong> An interviewer might conclude with a summary such as, "It seems that balancing work pressure and maintaining a social life are significant challenges for you. Is there anything else you’d like to add?" After turning off the recorder, the participant might then share more candid reflections, such as, "Actually, I’ve been considering leaving my job." If new information emerged, the interviewer should seek permission before including it in the research.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conducting an Interview</h2>

            <p>In "The Qualitative Research Interview: A Phenomenological and a Hermeneutical Mode of Understanding," Kvale (1983) offered insights into the nature and methodology of qualitative research interviews. He discussed two core approaches to understanding interviews: phenomenology and hermeneutics. These approaches aimed to generate knowledge by interpreting human experience through conversations.</p>
            
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Kvale introduced the concept of qualitative research interviews as a method of inquiry designed to understand the lived experiences of participants. The primary goal of such interviews was not merely to extract information, but to interpret the meaning behind the responses, integrating both phenomenological and hermeneutical perspectives. The focus of the study was on how knowledge was co-created in dialogue between interviewer and interviewee, with an emphasis on mutual understanding.</p>
            
            <h3>Phenomenological Approach</h3>
            <p>The phenomenological approach in qualitative research was described as a way to explore and describe the lived experiences of individuals. This method involved a deep focus on the subjective experiences of participants without imposing preconceived notions or external interpretations. Instead, the interviewer sought to bracket their own biases and engage fully with the participant’s account.</p>
            
            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><p><strong>Aims:</strong> The phenomenological approach aimed to allow the participant's lived experiences to emerge naturally, with minimal interference from the interviewer’s assumptions. The goal was to capture the essence of those experiences.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Process:</strong> Interviewers employing this method were expected to practice epoche, or bracketing, by suspending their own presuppositions to fully engage with the participant’s world. It involved empathetic engagement with the subject’s point of view, focusing on understanding the participant's perspective.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong> This approach necessitated respect for the participant’s voice, avoiding manipulation or distortion. Researchers had to ensure that they represented the participant’s experiences authentically and handled the data with care to maintain confidentiality.</p></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Hermeneutical Approach</h3>
            <p>The hermeneutical approach, in contrast, emphasized interpretation and understanding the underlying meanings within a participant’s responses. This approach was based on the idea that understanding is always situated in context, and knowledge is derived from interpreting the layers of meaning embedded in human discourse.</p>
            
            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><p><strong>Aims:</strong> This approach sought to uncover deeper, often hidden meanings behind the participant's words. It emphasized a more critical stance toward the surface meanings, probing beneath what was explicitly said to reveal implicit assumptions, contradictions, or cultural influences.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Process:</strong> The process of hermeneutic interpretation required a dialogical relationship between the text (or narrative) and the interpreter. The interviewer constantly moved between parts of the narrative and the whole to develop a coherent understanding of the participant's experiences.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong> One of the ethical challenges was the risk of over-interpreting or imposing external meanings that the participant might not recognize or agree with. Researchers had to maintain a balance between uncovering hidden meanings and respecting the participant’s self-understanding.</p></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Application of Phenomenology and Hermeneutics in Interviews</h3>
            <p>Both phenomenological and hermeneutical approaches could be applied in qualitative interviews to interpret participants’ experiences. The balance between these methods allowed the researcher to remain empathetic while critically analyzing the narrative for deeper understanding.</p>
            
            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><p>Phenomenology focused on describing the lived experience of the participants without distortion.</p></li>
                <li><p>Hermeneutics, on the other hand, involved interpretation, where the interviewer actively engaged with the text to reveal deeper meanings beyond the surface level.</p></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>The Researcher’s Role</h3>
            <p>The interviewer played a critical role in facilitating the interview process. In the phenomenological approach, the researcher was tasked with understanding the participant’s subjective meanings. In the hermeneutical approach, the researcher’s role extended to critically questioning the participant’s narrative to uncover hidden motives or unconscious influences.</p>
            
            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><p><strong>Example (Phenomenology):</strong> An interviewer, in this context, might focus on the participant’s explicit expressions of emotion or experience, asking questions like, "How did you feel in that moment?"</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Example (Hermeneutics):</strong> Alternatively, using a hermeneutical approach, the interviewer might explore deeper layers by asking, "What might have been influencing your actions at that time that you were unaware of?"</p></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Types of Questions in Phenomenological and Hermeneutical Interviews</h3>
            <p>Various question types were essential for guiding the interview, depending on whether the focus was more on describing (phenomenology) or interpreting (hermeneutics) the participant's experiences.</p>
            
            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><p><strong>Descriptive Questions:</strong> These aimed to gather direct descriptions of experiences. <strong>Example:</strong> "Can you describe how that event unfolded?"</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Interpretive Questions:</strong> These sought to delve into the meanings behind actions or experiences. <strong>Example:</strong> "Why do you think you reacted in that way?"</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Probing Questions:</strong> Asked for more detail or clarification. <strong>Example:</strong> "Can you give me an example of what you mean by 'challenging'?"</p></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Reflexivity and Ethics</h3>
            <p>Kvale (1983) emphasized the importance of reflexivity in both phenomenological and hermeneutical interviews. Reflexivity referred to the interviewer’s awareness of their own influence on the research and their attempts to minimize bias while respecting the participant’s narrative. Ethics were a central concern, especially regarding the interpretation and representation of the interview data.</p>
            
            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><p>Researchers were required to critically reflect on how their own biases might shape their interpretations, whether focusing on empathy (phenomenology) or skepticism (hermeneutics).</p></li>
                <li><p>Ethical challenges included ensuring that the participant’s voice was not distorted, especially when dealing with sensitive or marginalized subjects.</p></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Kvale concluded that the qualitative interview, whether approached through phenomenology or hermeneutics, required a delicate balance between understanding and interpretation. Researchers were advised to navigate the tension between describing the participant’s lived world and interpreting the hidden meanings within their narratives. The qualitative interview was positioned as a craft that required skillful attention to both the participant's experiences and the interviewer’s role in shaping the conversation.</p>
            
            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><p>Phenomenology allowed the interviewer to describe the participant’s reality as it was experienced.</p></li>
                <li><p>Hermeneutics encouraged the interviewer to interpret and question that reality, seeking deeper insights.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The paper by Polkinghorne (2005) described how qualitative research, particularly through interviews, aimed to describe and clarify human experiences as they appeared in people's lives. It was emphasized that qualitative research relied heavily on data in the form of spoken or written language, gathered through various sources like interviews, observations, and documents. This contrasted with quantitative research, which focused on numerical data. Interviews, in particular, served as a core method for gathering rich data that reflected the complex and multilayered nature of human experience (Polkinghorne, 2005).</p>

            <h3>Qualitative Research Methods</h3>
            <p>Polkinghorne noted that qualitative research methods clustered under an umbrella term encompassing multiple traditions, such as phenomenology, ethnography, grounded theory, and case study approaches. These methods used languaged data, which was the primary form of evidence in qualitative studies. The historical context of qualitative methods was also addressed, with special attention to how their reemergence in the mid-20th century impacted fields like sociology, education, and psychology. While earlier approaches focused on objectivity and statistical design, qualitative research developed as a response to studying human experience more deeply (Polkinghorne, 2005).</p>

            <h3>Production of Qualitative Data</h3>
            <p>Qualitative data were described as inherently different from quantitative data. In qualitative research, data consisted of narratives and discourse, emphasizing meanings and ideas expressed by participants rather than numerical reflections of reality. Polkinghorne emphasized that qualitative data were not "collected" in the same way quantitative data were; instead, qualitative data were produced through interaction, reflection, and dialog between the participant and the researcher. These interactions were shaped by the linguistic expression of the participants, and the production of interview data required both practiced skill and time (Polkinghorne, 2005).</p>

            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><p><strong>Data Sources:</strong> Interviews, observations, documents, and artifacts served as common sources of data in qualitative research. These sources allowed researchers to gather rich descriptions of human experiences, often transformed into written texts for analysis.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Interview Data:</strong> Interviews were a primary method for gathering qualitative data. Polkinghorne stressed the importance of the complexity of self-reports and the challenges of capturing lived experiences through language. It was noted that generating interview data of sufficient breadth and depth required significant time and skill (Polkinghorne, 2005).</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Historical Development of Qualitative Research</h3>
            <p>According to Polkinghorne, the development of qualitative research reflected different stages in the evolution of social science methodologies. Early qualitative studies were influenced by symbolic interactionism and anthropological field studies, but by the mid-20th century, behaviorism and statistical approaches had dominated. The reemergence of qualitative methods, marked by the publication of Glaser and Strauss's <i>The Discovery of Grounded Theory</i> (1967), reinvigorated sociological and psychological research (Polkinghorne, 2005).</p>

            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><p><strong>Stages of Development:</strong> Denzin and Lincoln’s (2000) stages of development in qualitative research were discussed, from the traditional period (1900s–1940s) to postmodern and post-experimental approaches (mid-1990s to present). Each phase introduced new methodologies while retaining earlier methods, leading to a matrix of qualitative techniques used across disciplines (Polkinghorne, 2005).</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Challenges in Data Collection</h3>
            <p>Polkinghorne discussed several challenges associated with collecting and interpreting qualitative data. A major issue was the translation of participants’ reflective awareness of their experiences into language, which often introduced distance between the actual experience and the expressed data. Self-reports, while valuable for studying human experience, had limitations due to participants' incomplete access to their own thoughts and their reliance on language to communicate them (Polkinghorne, 2005).</p>

            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><p><strong>Limitations of Self-Reports:</strong> Self-reports were noted to be inherently limited, as individuals could not fully access or explain their internal experiences. The subjective nature of these reports introduced challenges in translating experience into coherent data (Polkinghorne, 2005).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Language and Experience:</strong> The paper highlighted the complex relationship between language and experience, noting philosophical debates on whether language constructs or reflects reality. Polkinghorne suggested that while language shaped experience, it could also limit the depth of the data collected (Polkinghorne, 2005).</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Selection of Participants</h3>
            <p>The selection of participants for qualitative research was addressed, emphasizing that purposive selection strategies, rather than random sampling, were used to enrich the understanding of the experience under investigation. Participants were selected based on their potential to provide significant contributions to the understanding of a phenomenon, with the goal of collecting rich, saturated descriptions (Polkinghorne, 2005).</p>

            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><p><strong>Purposive Selection:</strong> This method of selection was essential to qualitative research, as it ensured that participants could provide detailed and relevant accounts of the experience being studied. This approach contrasted with random sampling, which was more typical in quantitative research (Polkinghorne, 2005).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Iterative Selection:</strong> The selection process often remained open, allowing researchers to select additional participants as the research evolved. This iterative process helped refine and deepen the understanding of the experience (Polkinghorne, 2005).</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data as Evidence</h3>
            <p>Qualitative data served as evidence for the phenomena being studied. Polkinghorne noted that in qualitative research, data were often in the form of narratives, which provided an indirect form of evidence about the experiences under investigation. These narratives allowed researchers to produce a core description of the experience, with interview excerpts often used to illustrate key findings (Polkinghorne, 2005).</p>

            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><p><strong>Textual Evidence:</strong> Evidence in qualitative research typically took the form of written texts, with interviews transcribed for analysis. The focus was not on the literal text itself, but on the meanings conveyed through the participants’ accounts (Polkinghorne, 2005).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Challenges of Data Transformation:</strong> The transformation of oral interviews into written text risked losing important nuances, such as intonation or pacing, which could affect the interpretation of the data (Polkinghorne, 2005).</p></li>

            <h3>Production of Interview Data</h3>
            <p>Polkinghorne highlighted the importance of skill and practice in conducting qualitative interviews. Effective interviews required building rapport with participants and encouraging them to share detailed accounts of their experiences. The interviewer’s role was to guide the conversation while remaining sensitive to the participant’s perspective, helping to produce a rich narrative that could be analyzed (Polkinghorne, 2005).</p>

            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><p><strong>Interview Formats:</strong> Various formats for conducting interviews were discussed, including one-on-one interviews and the interpersonal process recall (IPR) method, which involved video or audio recordings of sessions. These methods provided opportunities for participants to reflect on their experiences and offer in-depth descriptions (Polkinghorne, 2005).</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The paper concluded by emphasizing the importance of qualitative research in providing a deeper understanding of human experience. Polkinghorne stressed that while qualitative methods had limitations, they were invaluable for capturing the richness of lived experiences. As a researcher, attention to the linguistic nuances of participants’ expressions, careful selection of participants, and an iterative, purposive approach to data collection were key to producing meaningful and insightful findings (Polkinghorne, 2005).</p>

            <h2>How DeMar DeRozan Changed the Conversation Around Mental Health in Basketball</h2>

            <p>
                It all started with a simple tweet that would later go on to change the NBA's stance on mental health. DeMar DeRozan, who at the time was a Toronto Raptors star, opened up about his struggles with depression. By sharing his vulnerability, he sparked a movement that led to open conversations on mental health in professional sports.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Tweet That Started It All</h3>
            
            <p>
                On February 17, 2018, DeMar DeRozan posted a late-night tweet saying, <em>"This depression get the best of me…”</em>. At that time, DeRozan should have been on top of the world—he was an NBA All-Star, playing for the Raptors, the top team in the Eastern Conference. He was set to represent Toronto at the NBA All-Star Game in Los Angeles, near his hometown of Compton, California.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But despite his professional success, DeRozan was struggling internally. Overwhelmed by the pressure of expectations, social commitments, and his own mental health, he tweeted about his depression and went to sleep. When he woke up, his phone was flooded with calls and messages from friends, teammates, and even his coach, all concerned about his well-being.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Growing Up in Compton: Overcoming Obstacles</h3>
            
            <p>
                DeRozan grew up in Compton, California, a place notorious for violence and crime. For him, basketball became a lifeline—a way to escape the constant challenges that life in Compton presented. He shared how watching basketball tapes with his father, Frank DeRozan, helped foster his love for the game.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Drafted ninth overall in the 2009 NBA Draft by the Toronto Raptors, DeRozan quickly became one of the key faces of the franchise, especially after Chris Bosh’s departure in 2010. He embraced the responsibility with a tweet that read, <em>"Don't worry, I got us…”</em>, reassuring fans that he was ready to lead.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Ripple Effect of DeRozan’s Openness</h3>
            
            <p>
                After his tweet in 2018, many athletes and public figures began reaching out to DeRozan. His coach at the time, Dwane Casey, was one of the first to call and express his surprise. Casey had known DeRozan for years and had no idea the young star was struggling with depression.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Casey, like many others of his generation, had been taught to view mental health struggles as a form of weakness. But DeRozan's honesty forced him to reconsider, and he later acknowledged how important it was for sports teams to have mental health professionals on hand to support athletes.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Changing the Game Off the Court</h3>
            
            <p>
                DeRozan's public admission had a far-reaching impact beyond the basketball court. His tweet inspired players like Kevin Love, who wrote an article in The Player's Tribune detailing his own battles with mental health. Love later shared that DeRozan's tweet likely saved his life.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DeRozan's influence also caught the attention of the NBA. Just two months after his tweet, the league launched its Mind Health initiative, which aimed to raise awareness about mental health challenges in sports. By the 2019-2020 season, the NBA required every team to have licensed mental health professionals and psychiatrists available for players.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Ongoing Journey</h3>
            
            <p>
                Even today, DeRozan continues to work on his mental health. He admits that it’s an ongoing process, but he is better equipped to manage it. Whether it's finding peace in nature or taking a moment to rest, DeRozan has learned to prioritize his well-being. His openness has not only changed the NBA’s approach to mental health but has also inspired countless fans and athletes to seek help.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As former coach Dwane Casey said, "By him putting that tweet out, there's no telling how many lives he saved and how many players he helped to make it not such a bad thing to ask for mental help."
            </p>
            
            <h3>Legacy and Impact</h3>
            
            <p>
                DeRozan’s actions have paved the way for a more open and supportive conversation about mental health in professional sports. Teams across the NBA now have multiple mental health professionals on staff, thanks in large part to DeRozan's bravery. His willingness to share his struggles has made it easier for others to follow suit, and his influence continues to be felt both on and off the court.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Through his story, DeRozan not only changed the conversation around mental health but also created a lasting impact that has helped save lives and brought attention to the importance of mental wellness in high-pressure environments like professional sports.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            
            <p>
                The interviewer employed a semi-structured format that allowed for a natural flow while maintaining alignment with key themes such as mental health, athletic performance, and personal growth. This style of interviewing utilized open-ended questions, enabling DeRozan to elaborate on his mental health experiences, highlighting both his personal vulnerability and his broader influence on the NBA. By focusing on significant moments, such as DeRozan’s 2018 tweet about depression and his career’s highs and lows, deeper insights into his emotions and mindset were uncovered. This empathetic and patient approach demonstrated the importance of not merely gathering facts but also exploring underlying emotions, motivations, and meanings.

                Probing questions were also employed, particularly when DeRozan’s responses invited further exploration. For example, when he discussed emotionally "hitting a wall" before sending his tweet, a follow-up question could inquire about the buildup to that moment, contrasting his internal struggles with his outward successes. Such questioning would have provided a more textured understanding of his internal challenges.

                The interviewer remained attentive to the dynamics of the conversation, knowing when to pause and allow DeRozan the space to reflect further. These moments of silence, where participants were given time to process their thoughts, often led to more profound and revealing answers. For instance, after discussing sensitive topics like mental health, offering DeRozan time to reflect could have prompted further discussion on systemic changes in the NBA concerning mental health.

                By focusing on both DeRozan’s personal experiences and their broader societal impact—such as how his transparency led to mental health initiatives across the NBA—the interview effectively explored DeRozan’s individual journey and his influence on the conversation surrounding mental health in sports. This approach aligned with qualitative research methodologies, such as phenomenology or hermeneutics, where the lived experience of the participant is understood while interpreting those experiences within a broader cultural context.
